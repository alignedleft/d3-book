### Version

**Important:** Make sure you are using the correct version of these sample files!  Otherwise, the samples you see here may not exactly match the ones you see in the book.

This version is **in progress for the second edition**.  You probably don’t want this version, as it will only be of interest to Scott.

Check [the release page](https://github.com/alignedleft/d3-book/releases) to download version 1.0, which matches code shown in the first edition of the book, published March 2013.
